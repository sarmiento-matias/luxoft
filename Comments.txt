Overall:

- The existing code was refactored to follow industry-standard programming practices and adhere to best practices in both backend and frontend.
- Changes were made to the controllers in the backend (ASP.NET Core WebAPI) to utilize attributes like [ApiController] and [Route], and constructor dependency injection was applied. Additionally, proper input validation and HTTP status codes (e.g., Ok, NotFound, BadRequest) were implemented for responses.
- The frontend (Angular) code was improved by extracting API calls to separate services (UserService and MasterDataService) and employing dependency injection. Appropriate error handling using catchError was added in the services.
- A new UsersListComponent was created to display users, and Reactive Forms were used for user input validation.
- The code had some issues, such as URLs not pointing to the correct backend endpoints, calls to methods that were not yet implemented, and missing controls that resulted in the application not functioning as expected.
- These issues were identified and addressed during the refactoring process, ensuring that the application now works as intended and correctly communicates with the backend.
- Despite the improvements, it's important to note that the code still lacks a comprehensive set of unit tests. However, this omission was acknowledged and not included due to the project's scope limitations.
